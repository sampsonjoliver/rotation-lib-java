## Quaternion
Provides class constructors for a classical 4-wide Quaternion formatted as {w, x, y, z} from 3- or 4-wide vectors.

Provides standard Quaternion methods such as division, hamiltonian products, addition, substraction, length, norm, conjugates, inverse, versor, magnitude, dot product, etc.

Provides helpers for determining the angular distance between two Quaternions, a difference quaternion representing the change between two quaternions, and a conversion method to Tait-Bryan representation.

## Rotation Matrix
Provides methods to get a 3- or 4-wide and deep rotation matrix representing the rotation from a {w,x,y,z}-formatted rotation vector.
Provides a mmethod to get the angular difference between two rotation matrices.
